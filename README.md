##  Project Vision

This innovative project explores the intersection of **computer vision** and **traditional machine learning** to solve a classic real-world problem: **accurate house price prediction**. By combining visual information from property images with structured textual data, we create a multimodal AI system that understands properties holistically.

### 🚀 Key Innovation
Traditional price prediction models rely solely on numerical and categorical features. Our approach breaks new ground by incorporating **visual semantics** extracted by 21 different deep learning architectures, allowing the model to "see" and understand property characteristics that are difficult to quantify in tabular data.
